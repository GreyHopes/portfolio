Our goal was to make a portal-like narrative game, in it the player is playing as a woman who wakes up in a seemingly abandonned lab, she discovers she has the ability to split her soul from her body and become a sort of ghost which can go freely but not too far from your body.

The player has to use this mechanic and some interactable objects to solve puzzle and escape frome the lab.

Down below you can see several captures from the game :
