This game was made during the **WonderJam 2019 - Fall Edition** with a team of five peoples in 48 hours using the Unity Engine. 

The goal is to defend a space station from waves of enemies using spaceships that the player can move, deploy across the map and upgrade. 

I made most of the UIs of the game and the upgrade system.
