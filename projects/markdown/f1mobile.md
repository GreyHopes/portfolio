I worked on F1 Mobile racing during my internship at Eden Games. 

I mainly worked on a big refactoring of the quests system trying to make it more generic, reusable and easier to use for the designers. I had to produce a whole new system, developp new unity editor interfaces and delved a bit into server code while working with network programmers. 

The update containing my changes rolled out in late 2021 and is still in the game to this day.
