Promovols is a site that sells plane tickets. I've been part of the team that made the site during my internship as a fullstack developper and we successfully launched the site on January 2019. 

During this project we worked using agile techniques and I had to learn VueJs in self-formation.

I made several parts of the site such as : 
* The checkout process (Front and back)
* Some parts of the payment process
* The confirmation email with the email sending process
* Various other components
