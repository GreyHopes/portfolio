Gear.Club Stradale is a racing game made for Apple Arcade which runs on iOs, tvOS, and macOS.
I worked on the production of the 1.0 version as a Gameplay Programmer and on all the following 10 updates the game received since its launch as an Associate Lead Programmer.
I worked on all aspects of the game throughout the project's lifetime :
- New game modes from gameplay systems to UIs and implementation within the game.
- User interfaces and their interactions with the different game systems.
- Editor tools for designers.
- Handling of the player's save files both local and cloud with CloudKit.
- Game systems such as the club system, the shops, and the Carta Stradale.
- Native plugins to add capabilities related to GameCenter and Apple Music.
- Live support for the game if any critical bug were to be found.
- Coordination between the different teams.
- Day-to-day management of the gameplay programming team.
