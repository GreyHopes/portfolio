This game was made during the **WonderJam 2020 - Winter Edition** with a team of six people in 48 hours using the Unity Engine.

It's a local multiplayer game in which the players are playing as neighboring grandmothers who tries to destroy their neighbor's house using missle launchers they buy on Azamon using money from their lemonade stand.

I worked on UI and Gameplay elements, in particular the button smash mechanic and the delivery system.

You can get the game on [itch.io](https://maevatrivino.itch.io/grannies-war).
