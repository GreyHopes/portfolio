Timesick is game made in a team of 4 for the 8INF960 class at UQAC. We made a prototype of the game in 2 months using Agile Scrum methods.

The player is playing as a man who has a certain sickness that may kill him unless he gets a certain medicine which is possessed by a group of dangerous thugs. 

The goal is to sneak by the guards and retrieve the medicine from its container before the time runs out. I made most of the UIs, some gameplay elements and the trailer.
