This game was made for the 8INF960 (Networking for video games) class at UQAC in 1 months. 

The goal of the project was to learn to use the Unreal Engine and its networkings features (Mostly RPCs, Validation and Blueprints) using C++ scripts and Blueprints. We also used the Quixel Megapack for most of the games assets.

The game is a puzzle plateformer where two players have to cooperate to move through the level using the various plateforms and solve puzzles.

In the first level the players have to use pressure plates to make some plateforms move allowing the other player to move. All the platform movement is replicated accross the network.

In the second level the players have to open a door closed with a code. To open it, they have to find the combination and write it on several levers scattered across the level.
